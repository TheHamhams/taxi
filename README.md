Finished my first internship project for Data Glacier. We were asked to use provided data sets for a fictional company and decide which taxi company they should invest in. Afterwards, we created a powerpoint to communicate our findings and recommendation. 


I tried to answer questions I thought would be most relevant to which would be a good investment. My graphs are pretty simple, but I wanted to focus on them being clear and understandable rather than being fancy and pretty. 


As for the ppt, I wanted to showcase my skills as far as making the information clear and too the point. I used color to highlight which company was being analyzed and made a separate section to clearly state my conclusion.


I definitely faced some challenges in cleaning the data and extracting the information I wanted, but it was a great experience and I hope to use the lessons in future projects.
